<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a 29-year-old who left my career in the federal government to pursue new opportunities in life. I relocated to the Philippines to be with my future wife, taking a leap of faith to start a new career as a web developer. Although I had no prior knowledge of web development, I was willing to take the risk to be closer to my future wife.</p>


<p>In my youth, I aspired to become a professional baseball player. Although I played through college and had the chance to represent Team Philippines in the World Baseball Classic Qualifiers in 2016, I have since decided to seek out new challenges and pursue a different path. Playing competitive baseball taught me the value of dreaming big, taking risks, being disciplined, developing leadership skills, and working well in a team.</p>

<p>While coding always intrigued me, I never pursued it until now. I'm a risk-taker who enjoys exploring the unknown, even if it scares me. I confront my emotions, including fear, knowing that they ultimately make me stronger. Two of my favorite quotes are "The best teacher in life is your own experiences" by Nipsey Hussle and "There's beauty in the struggle, and ugliness in success" by J. Cole, and I strive to live by these teachings.</p>
